    Aging in cats is the process by which cats change over the course of their natural lifespans. As cats age, they
    undergo changes in health and behavior. Dental disease and loss of olfaction are common as cats age, affecting
    eating habits. Arthritis and sarcopenia are other common effects of aging in cats. The average lifespan of a cat may
    range from 10 to 13 years. How a cat's health is affected by aging may be managed through modifications in a cat's
    diet, accessibility adjustments, and cognitive stimulation.
